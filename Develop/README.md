# password-generator
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to able to use what I've learned in JavaScript so far to build a password generator.
- I built this project to generate a random and secure password to use for login credtianls on any application or website.
- It solves the problem of having a password that isn't complex enough which makes it harder for people to hack into your accounts.
- I learned a lot about JavaScript through this project. I learned how to create functions, use alerts, confirms and prompts, as well as loops
  and defining all variables to fit what the application needs.
